# Spam SMS Detection using Machine Learning

## Objective
Build a classification model to detect spam messages from SMS texts.

Used TF-IDF vectorization and SVM for high accuracy.

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify SMS messages as Spam or Not Spam using machine learning. We used TF-IDF vectorization to process text and trained multiple models like SVM, Random Forest, etc., finally selecting SVM for its high accuracy (98%).

## Columns:

label: Spam or Ham (converted to 1 and 0)
message: SMS content

## Steps to Run the Project
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Step 2: Install Required Packages
Step 3: Load and Preprocess the Dataset
Step 4: Convert Text to TF-IDF Vectors
Step 5: Train Machine Learning Models (Train different models and select model with high accuracy in this case i got SVM with high accuracy)
Step 6: Save the Model for Future Predictions
Step 7: Load Model & Predict New Messages
